# X-Original-To column
This addon adds a new column called X-Original-To in the message list which shows the original recipient address of the message (the contents of the X-Original-To header).

## TODO
something to rebuild msf files (or add the field somehow?)

## Credits
This addon source is based on "Full address column" by ≈Åukasz Kosson, which in turn is based on "SFreq" by Jorg K.
