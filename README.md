# X-Original-To column
This addon adds a new column called X-Original-To in the message list which shows the original recipient address of the message (the contents of the X-Original-To header).
This can be useful for systems with catch-all email addresses.

## TODO
something to rebuild msf files (or add the field somehow?)
